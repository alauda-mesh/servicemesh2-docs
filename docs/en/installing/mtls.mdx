# Enabling mutual Transport Layer Security

You can use Alauda Service Mesh for your application to customize the communication security between the complex array of microservices. Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) is a protocol that enables two parties to authenticate each other.

## About mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)

In Alauda Service Mesh, mTLS settings can be configured using the `Istio` resource.

`STRICT` mTLS mode can be configured using the `PeerAuthentication` and `DestinationRule` resources.

Review the following `Istio` resources and concepts to configure mTLS settings properly:

- `PeerAuthentication`

  defines the type of mTLS traffic a sidecar accepts. In `PERMISSIVE` mode, both plaintext and mTLS traffic are accepted. In `STRICT` mode, only mTLS traffic is allowed.

- `DestinationRule`

  configures the type of TLS traffic a sidecar sends. In `DISABLE` mode, the sidecar sends plaintext. In `SIMPLE`, `MUTUAL`, and `ISTIO_MUTUAL` modes, the sidecar establishes a TLS connection.

- `Auto mTLS`

  ensures that all inter-mesh traffic is encrypted with mTLS by default, regardless of the `PeerAuthentication` mode configuration. `Auto mTLS` is controlled by the global mesh configuration field `enableAutoMtls`, which is enabled by default in Alauda Service Mesh. The mTLS setting operates entirely between sidecar proxies, requiring no changes to application or service code.

By default, `PeerAuthentication` is set to `PERMISSIVE` mode, allowing sidecars in the Service Mesh to accept both plain-text and mTLS-encrypted traffic.

## Enabling strict mTLS mode by using the namespace

You can restrict workloads to accept only encrypted mTLS traffic by enabling the `STRICT` mode in `PeerAuthentication`.

**Example `PeerAuthentication` policy for a namespace**

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: <namespace>  # [!code callout]
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

<Callouts>
  1. Which `<namespace>` to apply the `STRICT` mTLS mode.
</Callouts>

You can enable mTLS for all destination hosts in the `<namespace>` by creating a `DestinationRule` resource with `MUTUAL` or `ISTIO_MUTUAL` mode when `auto mTLS` is **disabled** and `PeerAuthentication` is set to `STRICT` mode.

**Example `DestinationRule` policy for a namespace**

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: enable-mtls
  namespace: <namespace>  # [!code callout]
spec:
  host: "*.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local"  # [!code callout]
  trafficPolicy:
   tls:
    mode: ISTIO_MUTUAL
```

## Enabling strict mTLS across the whole service mesh

You can configure mTLS across the entire mesh by applying the `PeerAuthentication` policy to the `istiod` namespace, such as `istio-system`. The `istiod` namespace name must match to the `spec.namespace` field of your `Istio` resource.

**Example `PeerAuthentication` policy for the whole mesh**

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

Additionally, create a `DestinationRule` resource to disable mTLS for communication with the API server, as it does not have a sidecar. Apply similar `DestinationRule` configurations for other services without sidecars.

**Example `DestinationRule` policy for the whole mesh**

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: api-server
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  host: kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: DISABLE
```

## Validating encryptions with Kiali

The Kiali console offers several ways to validate whether or not your applications, services, and workloads have mTLS encryption enabled.

The **Services Detail Overview** page displays a **Security** icon on the graph edges where at least one request with mTLS enabled is present. Also note that Kiali displays a lock icon in the **Network** section next to ports that are configured for mTLS.
